# CRISM data guide  

This page will explain the steps needed to download, CAT process and ingest CRISM TRDR data into rasdaman. The last 
section contains a method to batch process CRISM MRDR data. 

## Prerequisites
1. ESRI ArcGIS 10+ with Python (2.7 for 10.1+ onwards)
2. IDL/ENVI and CRISM Analysis Tools (CAT, http://geo.pds.nasa.gov/missions/mro/crism.htm). CAT version 7.2.1. was used.
3. Download the files from https://github.com/planetserver/crism_rasdaman_ingestion
4. Download the files from https://github.com/planetserver/autocat. This contains 'diff' files. You need the original IDL routines which are provided in the CRISM Analysis Tools (CAT) download.

        ```
        blah
        ```
